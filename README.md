# DEALERSHIP REVIEWS AND RATINGS AND THEIR INFLUENCE ON CAR PRICES

## Motivation and Research Question
To fill the gaps in extant literature, this study investigates how ratings and reviews of US dealerships influence prices of the cars they sell. By identifying both what customers value, but also the issues they face when interacting with a dealership, this could help businesses improve their services, as well as gain competitive advantage over others. Finding the relationship between consumersâ€™ evaluations and prices could reveal new strategies for setting appropriate car prices and accelerate sales. This would not only support the economy, but also the businesses and local communities. Moreover, we extend the research by studying the impact of socio-economic indicators, which are different for each USA state.
